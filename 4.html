        <p>
        <p class="p2">I don’t remember what the sky looked like. I don’t remember who I was then, or what I looked like,
            but I
            remember being barefoot. I remember how soft the uncut grass felt after walking through our gravel driveway.
            I remember it being warm enough to feel relieved by the breeze. I was alone, looking through the bottom
            board of the border fence, my gaze out toward an empty field in Round Hill, Virginia. I heard a door shut in
            the distance behind me, and I saw my father moving to meet me. The edge of the fence ran rough against my
            skin as I climbed up to the top board. I wanted to be right there next to him, staring out at the fields and
            woods that surrounded us. I wanted to be at his level. He leaned against the fence next to me.</p>

        “It’s nice that it's warm out again. What do you see up here? Do you see what I’m seeing?” my father
        asked.<br>
        “Maybe.”<br>
        “I see lots and lots of bear country, and tonight we’re gonna get in the car and hunt
        some bears. Big, brown bears with razor-sharp claws.”<br>
        I laughed.<br>
        “I’m twelve now, Dad.”<br>
        “I know. I just want to. We don’t do much anymore. I-”<br>
        He stopped and let out a sigh.
        <br><br>

        <p class="p2">My dad was constantly enigmatic. He was, it seemed, a conscientious objector to characterization
            or
            classification. He was and still is difficult to describe. He was a 6’8, broad-shouldered, altogether
            graying man of about 200-something pounds. He loved animals. We had many dogs. He had two sons many years
            apart from different women and adopted a son before that. He had been married many times, more times than I
            may even know of. We three, his sons, rarely got the opportunity to be together. The age gap was too
            immense, and the hatred between co-parents was too great. I saw my half-brother Alex most often, on
            alternating weekends, but even then the frequency of our togetherness relied on the moods of our families.
            Despite his own fractured family, however, my father still embraced any child in his life as if they were
            his own. He’d done that with my older sister Savannah, my mom’s first child. My parents were never together
            but had known each other for decades, and from my mother, I had often heard that he was a wonderful man
            before I was around. She said that I only saw what he decayed into. As I grew up, he’d grown old and
            radically different. He went to bed in the early afternoon and got up hours before the sun would rise, and
            all he ever did was write. He would write constantly, by hand, about anything and everything. He scheduled
            his day to every half hour. He never cooked for anyone, not even us. He took more labelless pills and Nyquil
            than anyone should. He drank often. I didn’t understand him. I don’t know if anybody did by the time I was
            growing up. His capacities for doing right and wrong were extreme and equal. He was as capable of extreme
            bigotry and evilness as he was of grace and compassion. Everyone had an opinion of him, and as I see it now,
            everyone had trauma from him. He always had something ready to say, but it was rarely something good, and it
            was almost never about himself. He was direct and assertive, and at this moment, he looked at me and
            insisted we go bear hunting. He knew he wasn’t someone I could really say no to, but this insistence was
            different somehow. He looked at me, and when he did, I saw pleading in his eyes. This time, I felt he wanted
            my approval.</p>

            <div class="img"><img src="Dad (4).jpg"></div>

        <p class="p2">The bear hunting drives were only hunts by name. It was a game we played. We’d get in the car,
            listen to
            music, and drive around pretending to shoot something out the window every so often. He'd bring along a gun
            to sell it as a hunt, and I’d bring my popgun, so as not to be unprepared. I don’t remember how it started,
            but I remember how good it felt. It was one of the few times I ever felt close to him, and I wanted to be
            close to him. It was just a game, though. I knew that, I was twelve. Why do this now? It had been a very
            long time since I’d done anything with him, and most of what we talked about these days was not kind. I
            thought I was in trouble somehow. I usually was, and not without merit. I was comfortable acting out. For
            that, I thought he hated me, or at the very least, was burdened by me. As we walked back from the field to
            our house to grab the keys to the car, I tried my best to discover what he really had planned.
        </p>

        “Why do you want to drive around?”<br>
        “I want to hunt.”<br>
        “Yeah, but we're really just driving.”<br>
        “Well, I want to do that with you.”<br>
        As he popped the door open and grabbed the keys, I reminded him that we were missing equipment.<br>
        “Dad, the guns.”<br>
        “No.”<br>
        “Why not? We used to.”<br>
        He thought for a time about this as we walked to the car. He wasn't looking at me. As I prepared to get in
        the back, he popped open the front seat door and signaled to me.<br>
        “Because we're really just driving.”
        <br><br>

        He wanted me to sit in the front with him, which was a seat usually only reserved for my brother or left
        untaken. I was surprised. For as little as I knew of him, I knew he liked things in their place. He stared
        straight forward and patted me on my arm as we began to move.
        <br>

        <p class="p2">The hunt was really no different than the others we had gone on before. We drove through the
            field, listened
            to music, and sat quietly, and that was enough. We tried Blondie at first, but he settled on The Rolling
            Stones' more meditative work. I loved his music. He cared for what he listened to and had reverence for it.
            He gave it attention and was always listening to it. I was jealous of it. Despite my jealousy, the drive was
            nice, more so than it had been between us in a long time. I couldn’t shake my confusion, though. The hunt
            broke his usual pattern, and if he broke his pattern and wasn’t mad at me, then he was at my brother, I
            thought. That worked for me. I tried to imagine how this played a part in that. His way was to plan and
            there was intention in everything he did, and I couldn’t imagine that this was anything else. It didn’t
            matter though, I was in the clear. I was alone with my dad and all was good. I had grown accustomed to only
            really ever having half of his presence at any time, and this was no different. As we rounded the final
            curve of the forest edge for the fifth or sixth time, he decided to call it. It was half past six and just
            getting dark, and that was later for him than I’d seen in weeks. Wild Horses began playing through the
            speakers in front of us. I rolled the window down and felt the cool wind rush past my face. I looked at him
            and smiled. He didn’t look back. He just patted me again. This is the last time I remember seeing him or
            hearing his voice.
        </p>

        <div class="img"><img src="Dad (2).jpg"></div>

        <p class="p2">A few nights after this, my father killed himself. He shot himself through the heart with the gun
            I had
            asked him to bring on the bear hunt. I only recall a few specifics from the moments after I had found out
            most vividly. I lost feeling in my legs and my face went numb. Tears pearled from my eyes down my face, but
            I distinctly remember laughing. I was laughing at a prank that didn’t happen. I didn't believe it. It was my
            sister who had told me, and I thought I had misheard her. She collapsed onto me like a falling tree and
            wrapped her arms around me. She was sobbing into my back. I broke free and tried calling him twice, and on
            the third, my brother picked up. He was the one who found him, as he arrived for his week there the night I
            left. He didn’t know how to tell me. He could only croak out my name. We cried together.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">The next few weeks flew by like wind, but I barely noticed any time passing at all. By the time of
            his
            service, I could only feel numb to it all. The “sorry for your loss” and “this too shall pass” comments from
            strangers, whose faces all blended together in a communal attempt to say something, meant nothing. I was
            alone, utterly and completely. It was deeper loneliness than I thought possible, black and vast, draped over
            everything. I thought I could see him doing it, and I couldn’t stop seeing it for weeks. I was scared. I
            didn’t know the extent to which the world would change. Even cognisant of our relationship, I just wanted my
            dad. At that moment, the greatest suffering came from knowing that the world kept going, and I had to be a
            part of it still.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">Life beyond his death proved too big a task at first. I thought that through a tough demeanor and
            some
            broodiness, I’d be able to avoid some of the more traditional trauma, but I ended up having to deal with
            that in spades. I hated him for leaving me here, I hated myself for hating him. Everyone tries to warn you
            about abandonment feelings, nightmares, and anger problems, and they are right to do so. What stuck in me
            and hurt me most, though, was the little, acute stuff, like the unanswered calls, the cut-off sentences, and
            the subtler misunderstandings or misgivings from the past. Was a touch on the shoulder something that meant
            everything to him or meant nothing? To never get the opportunity to know, was the violence that came
            after.</p>

        <p class="p2">I wasn’t left completely unanswered, a boon of having a big family is their capacity to connect
            dots, but
            some of it I wish I didn’t know. For example, I found out some years later that a nightmare I woke up to in
            the nights before his passing was a real, live gunshot in our house. My mom found a bullethole in the
            ceiling that morning. Her guess was, that it was an early attempt at what he ultimately did. I don’t really
            know, and I’ve never wanted to speculate. I think my time is better spent somewhere else.</p>
            

        <p class="p2">Regardless of what I did and did not know, it took time to acquiesce to his death and our forever
            missed
            opportunity to learn about each other. There was something different that kept me up at night though, not so
            much a feeling of regret for what we missed, but one of guilt. It bore a hole in me. It was a literal,
            almost physical aching feeling. I remembered the bear hunt. How he was, what colossal signs I was missing in
            my youthful, self-centered ignorance. I couldn’t see that he was sick. I couldn’t see that his mistreatment
            of us, his children, was a reflection of his mistreatment of himself. That he was more scared and alone than
            anyone likely realized. I couldn’t see that maybe for him, the hunt was the last opportunity to experience
            the cool wind together and look past the trees out toward a world he didn’t feel like a natural part of. I
            didn’t see what he saw. I just remember yelling at him on the phone, endlessly, countless times over, and
            cursing his inability to try. Yet, despite all my anger, despite the real indignities and hardships he put
            me through without reason from time to time, I knew what he had done for me with the hunt. That he did try.
            He left me with something to know that he cared, in his own way, about how he failed, and how it hurt us and
            him. It was no apology, he wasn’t that kind of man, but it was something. That hole I felt, in the pit of my
            stomach, was bored from a feeling that I had wasted the last moments with him. For a long time, I felt
            guilty in some way for that. I wanted to idolize him, to excuse him, but to do that was to lie to myself,
            and that spawned guilt in me. I still feel it, now and again, and I don’t think I’ll ever not feel it. I
            know his behavior wasn’t to be excused, but to be understood. But knowing and feeling are two distinct
            aspects of our being. That guilt isn't ‘reasonable’, but how someone feels is rarely concerned with
            ‘reasonable’.</p>

            <div class="img"><img src="Dad (1).jpg"></div><br>

        <p class="p2">Eight years on, ‘the little stuff’ doesn’t mean the same thing. The little stuff now reminds me of
            the
            beauty of his best. The scratchiness of his beard when he knelt down for a hug, the way his hats fit when I
            tried wearing them, his thunderous sneezes, his morning music echoing through the house at 4:30 in the
            morning. I still feel that ache in my gut, and I’m not certain that’ll ever change, but now responsibility
            for that aching feeling lies not with guilt, but with the things I’ll never be able to do with him or show
            him. I’ll never get the opportunity to talk to him. I’ll never get to hit him for the times he failed us,
            and I’ll never get to thank him for the times he didn’t. I’ll never get the chance to embrace him and tell
            him that he isn’t alone in feeling how he does. I’ll never get the opportunity to understand him, and I’ll
            never be able to ask him about the whats and whys of our lives or our relationship. I want him to see how
            well I’m doing, and that I learned from his mistakes and his successes. He never got to see me as anything
            more than a boy. One to hunt bears with. I’d give anything to hunt with him one more time. To hear his
            voice, or hold his hand. To listen to the Stones again, and debate their best work with him. To even share a
            moment together in silence. To look at him, as who I am now. I’d like to think he’d appreciate that I don’t
            have to climb a fence any more to see what he sees, and to be there, with him, on his level.</p><br><br><br>
