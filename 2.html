        <div class="essay">Recently, I lost a huge part of my heart and soul. My Uncle Nelson passed away. He wasn't just an
        uncle, he was like a father to me.

        <div class="essay">After my own dad took his life in 2014, he took me under his wing. He showed
            me patience, compassion and unconditional love. I was lucky enough to snap these shots of his home and one of
            him in hospice with my cousin, Meghan.

        <div class="essay"> It took me a while to build the courage to share this. I went back and
            forth questioning if I should share it at all. I came to the conclusion that he might like a public tribute to
            him. <br>
            
            I also think he would like me sharing how organized his table of tools are.

        <div class="essay"> He was in pain, a kind of pain he wanted gone for a long time, but being in North Carolina, 
            and given how sick he was - all he could do was wait in it.
            That was the hard part, on them, and on me. I miss him dearly but I find comfort in knowing that he is free from that pain.
            I know he will always be with me.
